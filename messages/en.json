    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Comprehensive answers to your questions about our services",
    "q1": "Is dental implant surgery painful?",
    "a1": "Not at all! We use strong local anesthesia and modern techniques. You may feel pressure but no pain. After surgery, you may feel slight discomfort for 2-3 days that can be managed with pain relief medication.",
    "q2": "How long does the implant procedure take?",
    "a2": "The procedure takes 30-60 minutes depending on the number of teeth. After that, you need 3-6 months for the implant to fully integrate with the bone before placing the crown.",
    "q3": "Is there a warranty on implants?",
    "a3": "Yes! All implants are covered by a 10-year warranty. If your body rejects the implant (very rare), we take a new x-ray and try again at no extra cost.",
    "q4": "Is teeth whitening safe long-term?",
    "a4": "Yes, professional whitening is 100% safe when done correctly. We use approved gel at safe concentration + gum protection. Results last 6-12 months.",
    "q5": "When will I see alignment results?",
    "a5": "Clear aligners (Invisalign) work faster than traditional braces. You'll see noticeable results after 3-4 months. Total treatment usually takes 12-18 months depending on your case."
